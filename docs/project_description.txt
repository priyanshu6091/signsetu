Project Overview: Flashcard Frenzy Multiplayer
This is a real-time competitive quiz game where multiple players simultaneously answer the same flashcard questions. Think of it like a digital game show where speed and accuracy matter - the fastest correct answer wins the point, and everyone sees the results instantly.
Core Game Flow:

Players join a game room and see identical flashcards
Everyone races to submit the correct answer
First correct response earns the point
Scoreboard updates in real-time for all players
Complete match history is preserved for review
